# React Router Dom v6 Routes Not Rendering

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when upgrading from React Router v5 to v6: routes failing to render correctly.  The solution showcases how to properly configure the Routes component in v6 to ensure all routes render as expected.

## Problem

In React Router v5, the basic route configuration worked perfectly. After upgrading to v6, the same code would render nothing, regardless of the path.

## Solution

React Router v6 introduces significant changes, especially in how routes are handled.  The `Switch` component is removed in v6; the `Routes` component now only renders the first matching route. Ensuring all routes are defined correctly and the `element` prop is used appropriately is crucial for proper rendering.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start`

Navigate between routes to verify their proper functioning.
